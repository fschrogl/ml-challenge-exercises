# Machine Learning Challenge Exercises

This project contains my proposed solutions for all exercises from the [ING Machine Learning Challenge](https://radu-enuca.gitbook.io/ml-challenge/).
All Git repositories for ths challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/ML-Challenge).

The topics of the machine learning challenge are presented over a time frame of 6 weeks and each week comes with new
exercises that can or should be solved by the challenge's participants.
